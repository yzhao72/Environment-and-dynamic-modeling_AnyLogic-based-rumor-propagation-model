**Abstract:** Internet rumors are bad information generated by information distortion. Starting from the general process of rumor event propagation evolution during the epidemic of Covid-19, this paper studies the competitive propagation process of rumor information and rumor refutation information. Based on the SIR Model, the competitive propagation model of rumor information and rumor refutation information is constructed from the perspective of system dynamics, and Anylogi is used c software was used to realize the model simulation. The experiment shows that when the netizen's literacy is high, the spread scale of rumor information is significantly reduced. When the contact weight of rumor-refuting information in the node contact environment is large, it can effectively suppress the spread of rumors. Then it summarized the theoretical and practical significance of the research, and put forward some suggestions on the governance of bad information in cyberspace, such as improving the quality of Internet users and regulating the contact environment of network nodes.
